## Title: "Real World Coq -- An introduction to mechanically verified mathematical proofs"

Sept 5-9, 2022 | Sabanci University, Istanbul

Instructor: Emilio J. Gallego Arias (Inria)
Coordinator: SÃ¼ha Mutluergil
Teaching Assistant: Ali Caglayan

Duration of the course: 5 days

## Intro

Proofs constitute the backbone of both Mathematics and Computer Science (CS). Doing a mathematical proof requires domain knowledge, solid reasoning skills and applying reasoning techniques carefully step-by-step. It is a tedious and error-prone task. For this reason, computer scientists aim to develop programs/tools for mechanizing and/or automating the proof process. Coq is an interactive proof assistant developed for this purpose. Using Coq, one can define mathematical objects or computer programs, express theorems or assertions on these entities, and mechanically check correctness of them by either interacting with Coq or automatically by using so called proof tactics depending on the availability of an applicable one.

Coq is an industrial-scale tool successfully used for both research and commercial purposes. In 2005, famous four color theorem was proven in Coq yielding a proof library as a by product with general purpose features that could be used in many settings. A company named AbsInt develops and maintains an optimized, commercially used C compiler called CompCert. CompCert is specified, programmed and verified in Coq, and its performance is comparable with canonical GCC. 

Coq is a free open-source software developed and maintained by a large and active user community(https://coq.inria.fr/community.html). New extensions and Coq based tools are frequently introduced.  It has a [sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coq/) and active support can be easily found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coq) and [Stack Exchange](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/coq). Main supporter of COQ is INRIA - French public computer science institute. Its development and maintenance is managed by the [Coq Team](https://coq.inria.fr/coq-team.html). Dr. Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias, the instructor for this workshop, is a member of the core team.

This workshop aims to introduce Coq proof assistant through basic concepts and exercises from different fields. It will an interactive tutorial like Coq itself. Participants will have time to go through exercises during the tutorial, interact with the instructor and ask their questions. 

The workshop will be held at Sabanci University, Istanbul.

## Program/Schedule:

The course will take place using an intensive schedule, with 3 hours in
the morning for teaching, and 3 hours in the afternoon for exercises
(with the corresponding breaks of course)

Attendants are expected to follow the instructor along, as the lessons
themselves are interactive and allow the attendants to interact with them.

A laptop with internet connection is required, tho the lessons can be
downloaded locally if desired. The lessons require a modern web browser.

## Resumed syllabus:

- Day 1: Introduction to type theory as a mathematical language

       We will review the formal logical language that is at the base of
       interactive proof assistants such as Coq or Lean.

       We will introduce the concept of "functional programming", which
       lies at the root of the construction of Coq (or Lean) proofs, and
       review some common patterns often used in the field.

- Day 2: Core Coq tactics and proofs

       We will introduce the Coq proof assistant more in depth, and
       review how it is different from other programming languages.

       We will discuss Coq datatypes ("inductive types"), which are a
       powerful tool for the modelling of mathematical concepts, and we
       will discover the main proof techniques, tactics, and library
       objects available in Coq and the Mathematical components library.

       We will place special focus on the role of libraries and modular
       proofs.

- Day 3: Program verification

       We will give an overview of the main techniques used to verify
       the correctness of programs, including the definition of custom
       program logics, and compiler correctness by simulation.

       In this session, we will follow a proof style often found in the
       programming language literature.

- Day 4: Mathematics verification

       In this session, we will present a proof style a bit different
       from the previous one, which is more adapter to the construction
       of mathematical proofs.

       We will discuss libraries and proof techniques for (linear)
       algebra, classical analysis, and group theory.

- Day 5: Advanced topics and Extended Exercise session.

       We will briefly discuss some advances topics and trends in the
       area, to proceed with an extended tutorial session to allow
       participants to wrap their exercise sheets.
