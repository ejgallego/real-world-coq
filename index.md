## Title: "Real World Coq -- An introduction to mechanically verified mathematical proofs"

Sept 5-9, 2022 | Sabanci University (SU), Istanbul

Instructor: Emilio J. Gallego Arias (Inria)
Coordinator: SÃ¼ha Mutluergil (Sabanci University)

Duration of the course: 5 days

### Required Software

Each participant is expected to bring their own laptop. A laptop is
required as the course is interactive.

The course requires a recent version of the Chrome Web Browser. Other
browsers may work, but they are supported at your own risk.

Lessons will take place using the [jsCoq](https://coq.vercel.app/)
software. Please, click on the above link and **check the tutorial
works** on your computer.

Internet connection is much recommended but not required, let us know
if you can't connect to internet and we will find a way to distribute
the files.

### Location

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:**

Lectures will take place physically at

> Sabanci University, **FENS (Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences) L029**

everyday between 08.40 - 15.30.

Check [the campus map below](#campus map) for locating the room. In
this map, **FENS** is marked with number 11 and L029 is at the L (-1)
floor. Entrance through the FASS side (building number 12) is to the G
(0) floor and entrance through the cafeteria (building number 21) is
to the 1st floor. So, you have to go 1 floor down in the former case
and 2 floors down in the latter case. Then, you can locate the room
looking at the floor plans (basically L029 is at the corner with sides
looking to buildings 12 and 13).

### Course Forum

There is a [Course Forum](https://coq.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/341461-Sabanc.C4.B1-Coq-Course---Sept-2022)
hosted at Coq's Zulip.

## Introduction

Proofs constitute the backbone of both Mathematics and Computer
Science (CS). Doing a mathematical proof requires domain knowledge,
solid reasoning skills and applying reasoning techniques carefully
step-by-step. It is a tedious and error-prone task. For this reason,
computer scientists aim to develop programs for mechanizing and/or
automating the proof process. Coq is an interactive proof assistant
developed for this purpose. Using Coq, one can define mathematical
objects or computer programs, express theorems or assertions on these
entities, and mechanically check correctness of them by either
interacting with Coq or automatically by using so called proof tactics
depending on the availability of an applicable one.

[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) is an industrial-scale tool successfully
used for both research and commercial purposes. In 2005, famous four
color theorem was proven in Coq yielding a proof library as a by
product with general purpose features that could be used in many
settings. AbsInt company develops and maintains an optimized,
commercially used C compiler called CompCert. CompCert is specified,
programmed and verified in Coq, and its performance is comparable with
canonical GCC compiler.

Coq is a free open-source software developed and maintained by a large
and active [user community](https://coq.inria.fr/community.html). New
extensions and Coq based tools are frequently introduced.  It has a
[sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coq/) and active support can be
easily found on [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coq) and [Stack
Exchange](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/coq). Main
supporter of COQ is INRIA - French public computer science
institute. Its development and maintenance is managed by the [Coq
Team](https://coq.inria.fr/coq-team.html). Dr. Emilio Jesus Gallego
Arias, the instructor for this workshop, is a member of the core team.

This course aims to introduce Coq proof assistant through basic
concepts and various exercises. The course will be conducted by
Dr. Emilio Jesus Gallego Arias (primary instructor), a member of the
[Coq Core Team](https://coq.inria.fr/coq-team.html), and Ali Caglayan
(teaching assistant), also a member of the [Coq
team](https://coq.inria.fr/coq-team.html). The course will consist of
lectures including interactive and hands-on exercises. The lectures
will be conducted in English. Occassional help with Turkish-English
translation will be provided by the TA and the coordinator.

The first edition of the course will be held at Sabanci University,
Istanbul as a workshop between 5-9 September. Lectures will be
hybrid. The attendance is limited to 20 physical and 10 online
participants. Application information and further details on the
workshop is provided below.

## Important Dates

Application Deadline: 31 August
Notifications: 1 September
Workshop: 5-9 September

## Registration

Only registered participants are allowed to attend the workshop. The
capacity is limited to 20 pyhsical, 10 online people. For registraion
(both online and physical), please fill the following
[form](https://forms.gle/amVNTKTNvemS73Ki6). Participants will be
picked by first come first served principle.

Registration is free for both online and physical
attendance. Unfortunately, no funding is available for transportation,
accoommodation and food, not even for the students.

## Transportation

The workshop will take place at SU Tuzla Campus. It is adjacent to
Istanbul Anadolu Highway (TEM, E-80) and 20 minutes drive away from
Sabiha Gokcen International Airport.

Transportation serviceses are mainly provided by shuttles of Gursel
Turizm. Shuttle schedule can be seen at
https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/shuttle-hours

Otherwise, IETT bus: KM18 can be taken, which has a stop directly
inside of Sabanci University.

Another alternative is taking a taxi from from Tavsantepe metro
station, which can be more costly but more comfortable as well.

Note that Gursel Shuttles also have departures from Pendik metro
station, which can be useful for those who want to use metro-shuttle
combination.

## Accommodation

There are no housing options inside Sabanci University
Campus. Unfortunately, the guesthouse will be closed for maintenance
during the workshop dates. Only in campus accommodation option for
workshop participants is student dormitories. 2-person rooms are
reserved for participants. Rates for staying single in the room is 800
try/night and sharing the room with another person is 400 try/night.

SU has a main cafeteria (Akkol) that serves breakfast (07:30 - 10:30),
lunch and dinner (11:30 - 20:30) at reasonable prices. In addition,
there are alternatives like Kucuk Ev, Subway, Pizza Bulls, Starbucks,
Piazza, Kopuklu Kahve and Fasshane inside the campus.

Unfortunately, no funding is available for reimbursing food and
accommodation expenses of participants.

## Schedule and Syllabus:

The course will take place using an intensive schedule, with 3 hours in
the morning for teaching, and 3 hours in the afternoon for exercises
(with the corresponding breaks).

Attendants are expected to follow the instructor along, as the lessons
themselves are interactive and allow the attendants to interact with
them.

A laptop with internet connection is required, tho the lessons can be
downloaded locally if desired. The lessons require a modern web
browser.

### Day 1 (Sep 05th, 2022): Introduction to type theory as a mathematical language

We will review the formal logical language that is at the base of
interactive proof assistants such as Coq or Lean.

We will introduce the concept of "functional programming", which lies
at the root of the construction of Coq (or Lean) proofs, and review
some common patterns often used in the field.

### Day 2 (Sep 06th, 2022): Core Coq tactics and proofs

We will introduce the Coq proof assistant more in depth, and
review how it is different from other programming languages.

We will discuss Coq datatypes ("inductive types"), which are a
powerful tool for the modelling of mathematical concepts, and we
will discover the main proof techniques, tactics, and library
objects available in Coq and the Mathematical components library.

We will place special focus on the role of libraries and modular
proofs.
