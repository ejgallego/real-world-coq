## Title: "Real World Coq -- An introduction to effective theorem proving"

Real World Coq is an ongoing project to create an online interactive
theorem proving course, aimed to complement existing teaching
materials with more advanced theorem proving patterns seen in other
courses.

As of today, we have done several short tutorials, the materials are
available online.
